* ask for review/assign/request validate the map
1. 
Hi Jerry,
I completed this map yesterday but I got to assign to you/Dane. So, initial mapping complete and ready for validation. Please help me review my map.
2.
Hi Jerry,
I made changes as your suggestions:
-Remove UOM mapping and Price mapping
-Update Document date to d-M-yyyy
-Set up Line Total
The below are all of my assumptions:
1. No group separator for numbers as it is not indicated in sample POs
2. Decimal separator is a comma
3. Default country code is set as BE (Belgium)

3.
Hi Dane,
Thank you for your support. I remove the 2rd group.
So, please review my mapping again.

I am feeling very unwell this morning so I will be resting. If it improves by the afternoon I will come back online. Otherwise hopefully I will be back at full steam tomorrow. Iâ€™ll check zoom and email periodically.
